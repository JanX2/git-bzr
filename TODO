Add a man page (git-bzr.1) so that "git help bzr" works

Features
--------

Add a way to show all bzr remote bzr branch names (similar to "git remote show");
  nb. "git branch" will show bzr remotes as normal git branches, but it would
  be useful to have a git-bzr option to show only bzr remotes.

Add a way to delete remote bzr branches (similar to "git remote rm")
Add a way to rename remote bzr branches (similar to "git remote rename")
  nb. Using "git branch rm" and "git branch mv" does not update the git-bzr info
  in .git/config, so it would be useful to have a git-bzr specific command that
  keeps that info in sync.
Add a clone command to make it easier to import a bzr as a git repository from
  scratch. Simplified workflow for this: mkdir, git init,
  git bzr add $branch $location, git bzr fetch $branch, git merge $branch.
  $branch should be chosen automatically.
