git-bzr: a bidirectional git - bazaar gateway
---------

## What does it do?

This script allows you to add bazaar repositories as git branches in your git repository. After that, you can fetch the Bazaar repo, make some changes, and push it back into Bazaar.

## How does it work?

An example session goes like this:

  $ git init
  $ git bzr add upstream ../bzr-branch
  $ git bzr fetch upstream
  $ git checkout -b local_branch bzr/upstream
  $ Hack hack, merge merge....
  $ git bzr push upstream

## How should I install it?

You need a new Git (v 1.6.0 or higher).

Furthermore, you need the Bazaar fastimport plugin. It can be found at https://launchpad.net/bzr-fastimport.

Finally, you need to install the git-bzr script somewhere.

## How is it licensed?

The git-bzr script is licensed under the same license as Git.
