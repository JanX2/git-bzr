git-bzr: a bidirectional git - bazaar gateway
=============================================

This script allows you to add bazaar repositories as git branches in your
git repository. After that, you can fetch the Bazaar repo, make some
changes, and push it back into Bazaar.

Usage
-----

An example session goes like this:

  $ git init
  $ git bzr add upstream ../bzr-branch
  $ git bzr fetch upstream
  $ git checkout -b local_branch bzr/upstream
  $ Hack hack, merge merge....
  $ git bzr push upstream

Installation
------------

You need a new Git (v 1.6.0 or higher).

Furthermore, you need the Bazaar fastimport plugin. It can be found at
https://launchpad.net/bzr-fastimport; to fetch it, run:

  $ bzr branch lp:bzr-fastimport

Finally, you need to install the git-bzr script somewhere.

License
-------

The git-bzr script is licensed under the same license as Git.
